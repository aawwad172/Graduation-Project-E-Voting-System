# E-Voting System Using Blockchain

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement a secure and transparent electronic voting system leveraging the Ethereum blockchain and Node.js for backend services. It is designed to ensure the integrity of the voting process, allowing users to vote securely from anywhere, anytime.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain-based Voting:** Utilizes smart contracts on Ethereum for immutable, transparent voting and tallying.
- **Node.js Backend:** Manages user registration, election creation, and preliminary checks to optimize costs and performance.
- **Secure Voter Registration:** Ensures that only eligible voters can register and vote in elections.
- **Real-time Voting Analytics:** Provides administrators with real-time data on voter turnout and election progress.

## Technologies Used

- **Ethereum Blockchain:** For creating and executing smart contracts.
- **Solidity:** Programming language for writing smart contracts.
- **Node.js:** For building the backend application.
- **Web3.js / Ethers.js:** Libraries for interacting with Ethereum from the Node.js application.
- **React:** For building a user-friendly frontend.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: You must have the Long Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js installed on your system. This is required to ensure compatibility with the project dependencies. Download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

- **Ethereum wallet** with some Ether for deploying contracts (for testing purposes).

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aawwad172/Blockchain_E_Voting_System.git
   cd Blockchain_E_Voting_System
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Environment Variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your Ethereum wallet private key and Infura API key.

4. **Run the Node.js Application:**

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

This addition clearly outlines the necessity of having the Node.js LTS version and provides a direct link to where it can be downloaded, ensuring users have the right environment setup before proceeding with installing or running your project.
